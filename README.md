# Cardekho---SK
**Objective**
Enhance customer experience and streamline the pricing process at CarDekho by leveraging machine learning to predict used car prices. This project involves creating a user-friendly Streamlit web application that enables users to input car details and get accurate price predictions in real-time.

**Project Scope**
The dataset includes historical car price data from multiple cities, containing features like make, model, year, fuel type, transmission, and other attributes. The goal is to preprocess the data, develop machine learning models, and deploy a prediction application for end-users.

**Deliverables**
Source Code: Includes data preprocessing, model training, and deployment scripts.
Documentation: Detailed explanation of methodology, models used, and results.
Visualizations: Insightful EDA and feature importance plots.
Predictive Model: Accurate ML model integrated into a Streamlit app.
Interactive Application: A deployed tool for predicting used car prices.
**Approach**
1. **Data Processing**
Import and Concatenate: Merge datasets from different cities into a single structured dataset, adding a "City" column to distinguish rows.
Handling Missing Values: Impute missing numerical features with mean/median and handle missing categorical values with mode or a new category.
Standardizing Formats: Clean up inconsistent data formats (e.g., removing units like kms) and ensure proper data types.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Apply one-hot or label encoding to transform categorical variables into numerical formats.
Normalizing Features: Scale numerical columns using Min-Max or Standard Scaler techniques.
Outlier Treatment: Use IQR or Z-score methods to identify and handle outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Perform descriptive statistics to understand feature distributions.
Visualize relationships using scatter plots, box plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.
Identify key features impacting car prices through correlation analysis and domain knowledge.
3. **Model Development**
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).
Experiment with various regression models, including:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines
Perform cross-validation for robust evaluation.
Apply hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search.
4. **Model Evaluation**
Evaluate model performance using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared
Compare models and choose the best one for deployment.
5. **Deployment**
Streamlit Application:
Input car features via a simple and intuitive user interface.
Display real-time price predictions.
User-Friendly Design:
Provide clear instructions for user inputs.
Include error handling for invalid inputs.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
Machine Learning: Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting)
Deployment: Streamlit for creating a web application

**Evaluation Metrics**
Model Performance:
